Subject: [PATCH 21/39] x86/boot: Reduce lower limit of physical KASLR

Set lower limit of physical KASLR to 64M.

Previously is was set to 512M when kernel is loaded higher than that.
That prevented physical KASLR from being performed on x86_32, where
upper limit is also set to 512M. The limit is pretty arbitrary, and the
most important is to set it above the ISA hole, i.e. higher than 16M.

It was not that important before, but now kernel is not getting
relocated to the lower address when booting via EFI, exposing the
KASLR failures.
